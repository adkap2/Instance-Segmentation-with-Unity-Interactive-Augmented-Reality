# Interactive Augmented Reality for Semantic Segmentation on Indoor Environments

# Introduction

This project is primarily focused on the navigation of an autonomous agent within a virtual environment created with the help of Unity; a tool primarily used to develop simulations for computers, consoles, and mobile devices. The agent would perform trivial tasks such as retrieving an object from its surroundings or avoiding obstacles, among other things. The agent will need access to instance segmentation models, such as YOLACT, a framework suited to recognize target items. Moreover, with the help of specific packages like ml-agents available within Unity [17 (Unity Technologies 2022)], it is possible to create a virtual environment where multiple simulations can be performed to test the capabilities of real-world robotics within a safe, isolated environment.
