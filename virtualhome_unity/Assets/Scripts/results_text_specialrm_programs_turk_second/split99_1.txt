Cut my toenails
I like to cut my toenails sitting in the middle of my bed, because it puts the nail up closer to my face to see it, and makes me able to stretch out. First I sit in the middle of the bed. I out a towel on the bed where my foot will be to catch the toenail clippings. I put an ashtray to the side of me to put the toenail clippings in when they fall on the towel. Before I start clipping, I put lotion on the toenails and rub it in really good. I let it sit there and soak for a few minutes before I start clipping. This makes the toenail softer and easier to clip, and is less painful. Once the lotion has soaked in, I start clipping the nails. I pick up each nail clipping when it falls on the towel and put it in the ashtray so they don't fall off the towel on the bed. When I am done clipping the nails, then I take the towel and roll it inwards so no clippings will fall out, and I take it to the garbage can and shake it out over the can so any stray clippings fall in the can. This procedure makes clipping toenails easier, as well as more private by doing it in the bathroom, instead of taking over the bathroom so others can't use it.
