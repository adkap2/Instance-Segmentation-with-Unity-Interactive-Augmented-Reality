Read to child
Either choose a book yourself, or let the child choose their own story.  Settle into a comfortable position with child, so you can both see the book--bed, chair, floor, anything cozy will do.  Open book, read the title (and author if the child is older).  Turn pages one by one, reading the story and responding to any questions the child might have during process.  Finish story.  Close book, return to shelf.
