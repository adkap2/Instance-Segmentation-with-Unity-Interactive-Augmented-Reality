Clean the dining table.
To clean the dining table I wait until each person has finished eating dinner and has excused themselves from and left the dining area. I then begin to remove all the dishes that have been served. I take them away first and give them to someone to put away. I then begin to remove all dinnerware form the table. This includes the plates and utensils, that were used for eating dinner. The plates, forks, knives, spoons and napkins must be removed and given to someone who will clean them. I make sure everything is removed form the table. I then take a cleaning cloth and wipe the table careful to be sure it is clean. I then push each chair back up under the table in a neat fashion.
