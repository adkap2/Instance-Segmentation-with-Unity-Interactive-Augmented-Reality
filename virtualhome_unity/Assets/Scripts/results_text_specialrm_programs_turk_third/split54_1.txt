Wash dishes
I fill up the sink with warm water and soap, and let the really dirty pots soak in the water while I load up the dishwasher. I open the dishwasher and put the cups on the top rack and plates and bowls in the bottom rack. I fill the soap tray in the dishwasher with dishwasher soap and close the door. Then I push the button that starts the normal wash cycle. Then I return to the sink and use a rough scrub sponge to scrub any remaining food off  the pots. Finally I rinse the pots in hot water and set them in the dish rack to air dry.
