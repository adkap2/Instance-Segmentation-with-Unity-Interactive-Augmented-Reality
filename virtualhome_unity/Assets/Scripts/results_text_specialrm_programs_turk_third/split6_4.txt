Deep-clean my front door.
For feng shui purposes, clean front door really, really well to attract new opportunities into my life.  Wash the door inside and outside, use Windex to clean the glass portions, scrub the metal strip on the threshold, mop the floor inside the front door, sweep the leaves and dirt away outside the front door, dust on top of the wooden door frame.  Make the front door really clean!
