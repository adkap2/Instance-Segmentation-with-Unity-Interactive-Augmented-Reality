Shower
After closing the door I take of my cloths. Stepping into the tub I step back until the water is hot. I then step under the water and use my natural made soap to clean my self. I then rinse off and then just stand under the water for awhile and let the hot water sooth any aches and pains. I then dry off  and put my jammies on and go to bed.  I do this in the morning since I work at night.
