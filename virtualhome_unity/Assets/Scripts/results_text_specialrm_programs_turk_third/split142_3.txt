Pluck eyebrows
Groom your eyebrows by looking at a mirror that is either very close to your face, or magnified. Use a set of tweezers to groom eyebrows. Hold tweezers with enough contact to keep in hand, but not closing the tweezers. This works best between thumb and a bent pointer finger. Put one arm of tweezer on one side of the hair, and one on the other. Gently close tweezers on the hair until it feels to be grasped firmly. Quickly pluck it out. You should see the root of the hair if done properly, if not you have only broken off the hair. Continue with stray hairs under the arch of brow that do not fit into the general shape of the eyebrow, at the tip of the brow near the cheek, random stray hairs above brow, and near/above the bridge of the nose. Caution: it might hurt and/or become inflamed (red)
