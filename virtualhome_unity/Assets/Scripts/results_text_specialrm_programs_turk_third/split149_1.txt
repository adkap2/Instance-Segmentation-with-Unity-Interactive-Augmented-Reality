Make scrambled eggs (egg whites)
Put a pan on a stove and set the temperature to medium. Pour egg whites from a carton in to a pan, about the size of a normal hand. Take a spatula and move the eggs around in the pan so that it cooks and the eggs scramble and don't just stay in one spot. Do this for 5-8 minutes until the eggs aren't runny anymore. Add salt and/or pepper. Scoop the eggs from the pan on to a plate.
