Feed the fish
I turn off the fish tank light and open the lid. I open the canister of fish flakes and get a pinch to throw on top of the water in the tank. Then I replace the lid and turn the light back on. I watch the fish eating for awhile because they're pretty. Then I put the lid on the canister. Put canister next to the fish tank.
