Feed two cats afternoon snacks.
Pet two hungry cats who are sitting on kitchen counter, open cupboard where their cat food is stored, select various bags of Temptations treats, shake bags as I open each one so that cats get excited with anticipation, set out two clean dishes and sprinkle various treats in bowls, cats eat their treats.
