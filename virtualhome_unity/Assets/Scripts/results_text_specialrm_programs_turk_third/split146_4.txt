Vacuum the room.
Plug in a vacuum cleaner. Using the rug sweeper part, run it over the rugs. Remove the sweeper part and use an attachment part, with a brush, or a nozzle to pick up small difficult bits, or to go over fringes. Replace the nozzle, or brush attachment with a floor sweeper. Remove obvious impediments, such as toys, and then vacuum. Use the nozzle attachment to clean the corners and the brush attachment to go over baseboards.
