Floss teeth.
Open the lid of a container of floss. Generally, there is a bit of thread-like matter, or floss, that can be grasped. Pull it until you have a sizeable length of floss, about 5-6 inches will do, as you will need to hold it and stretch it between your teeth. Wrap the ends around  the tops of your index fingers and pull tight. Use the tightened length in a sawing motion to reach upwards between each tooth on the upper row of teeth in your mouth. Then do the same along the bottom Be sure to start at the top of each tooth and move down to the gum line with each. The spaces between each tooth should be explored for food bits.  When finished, fill a glass with water. Rinse.
