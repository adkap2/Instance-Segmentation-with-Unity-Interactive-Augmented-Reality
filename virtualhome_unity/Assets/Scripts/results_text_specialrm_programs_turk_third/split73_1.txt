Wash dishes
I turn on the hot and cold water in the kitchen sink and fill up a tub full of water. I pour a little dish detergent into the tub of water until the water is soapy, then I add dishes to the soapy water. I let the dishes sit for a few minutes then I continue to wash and remove the debris from the dirty dishes. Once the dishes are rinsed off, I place them to the side to dry.
