Work on my affiliate website.
Sitting in teak deck chair with wooden drawing board on my lap, draw pictures of feng shui objects, like Laughing Buddha or Happy Cats, using China markers and cotton paper.  Cut out mat board backing the same shape as drawings.  Attach backing to drawing using scotch tape.  Photograph drawings using digital camera.  Write posts about the feng shui objects and add pictures of the drawings to the posts.  Publish the posts on Internet.
