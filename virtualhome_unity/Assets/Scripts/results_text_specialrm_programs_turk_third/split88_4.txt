Change a light bulb
It seems a little dark in here. A light bulb is not burning. I get a chair and a new light bulb. I climb on the chair to remove the old bulb. I lay it on the table and pick up the new bulb. I place it in the light socket and twist until it comes on. I climb down and throw the old bulb away and return the chair to its proper place.
