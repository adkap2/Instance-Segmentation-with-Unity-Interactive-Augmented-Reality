Pack lunches
I get lunch meat and cheese out of the refrigerator, grab some bread and miracle whip. Get 2 pieces of bread and put the lunchmeat, cheese and miracle whip on one and put the other piece on top. Put it in a sandwich bag. In other bags I put chips, cookies, apple slices, etc. Put all the sandwich bags into a lunch box.
