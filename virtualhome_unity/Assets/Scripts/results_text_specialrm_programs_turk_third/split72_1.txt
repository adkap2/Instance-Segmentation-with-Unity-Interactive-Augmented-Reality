Blow dry hair
Once out of the shower, comb hair until no tangles are noted.  Turn on blow dryer and begin to dry hair.  Make sure to dry the underside and areas near the scalp.  Once 50% dry, start using the brush of your choice to style/straighten hair.  Select pieces throughout hair and individually comb and style hair.  Continue until all of hair is dry.
