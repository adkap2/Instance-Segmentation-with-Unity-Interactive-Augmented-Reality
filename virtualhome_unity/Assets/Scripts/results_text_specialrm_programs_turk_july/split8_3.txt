I practice my own singing
I sit at the piano, vocalize with exercises that my own voice teacher taught me before he passed away.  After I vocalize, I use my portable microphone and my CDs to sing my church music or other songs I'm working on and I sing them so I can get better and I turn become a better teacher.
