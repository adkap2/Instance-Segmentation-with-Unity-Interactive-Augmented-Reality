Vacuum my bedroom
Get the vacuum and the stick attachment from the closet. Carry them in. Plug in the vacuum cord to the outlet. Turn the vacuum on. Run the suction of the vacuum over all the surfaces of the floor of the room in order to suck up dust. Attach the stick attachment to the round suction section of the vacuum and then use the attachment to vacuum under the furniture. Then remove the stick attachment, unplug the vacuum and put it away.
