Turn on the ceiling fan when i walk into the room
My home office often gets hot due to computers running all day long and heating up the room.  I would like the overhead ceiling fan to automatically turn on to its lowest setting when I walk into the room.  A motion sensor could trigger the ceiling fan to turn on.
