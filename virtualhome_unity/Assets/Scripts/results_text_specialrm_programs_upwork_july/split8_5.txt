Mail a signed letter to a customer
If a customer requires a signed hard copy oa contract or other document, I print out the document, sign it, and fold it up and place in an an envelope.  Next I write the customer address on the envelope and place a stamp on the front of the envelope.  Finally, I drop it off in the mailbox for delivery to the customer.
